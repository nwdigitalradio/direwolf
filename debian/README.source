The documentation PDFs are built from the corresponding *.docx Microsoft Word
documents in the debian/ directory. These are produced using the Save As PDF
function in Microsoft Word.

The PDFs are included in the source package to remove the need to automate this
PDF creation as part of the build process. If these documents are modified, the
corresponding PDFs should be reproduced.
