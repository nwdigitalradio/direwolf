In order to start direwolf as a service the configuration file
/etc/direwolf.conf needs to exist. Otherwise attempting to start the service
returns an 'Assertion failed' error. An example configuration file which may be
used as a model can be found in
/usr/share/doc/direwolf/examples/direwolf.conf.gz
